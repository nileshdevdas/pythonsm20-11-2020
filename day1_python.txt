Does python have a datatype :  Yes but is is mandatory NO 
What is python is dynamically typed language :- 

a = 10 
a = "Nilesh" 
a = []
a = {}
a = def 


.py ---> Pure text 

python ---> REPL 
python ----> .py 

1. Is python strictly typed Language : Is dynamically 
	datatype need not be mentioned 
	int 
2.  Is not a  language that is using any kind termiator or block 
	python is indented language 

	in python everthing is indented

Central repository of dependencies : 
I want to connect to a database called :- postgres 
pypi 

pip (Python Package Installer) 
pip install <packageName> 

a developer 1 : X who write a code in python and he uses some 10 libraries in his code :- 
He needs to checkin his code into a central scm (Source Contro Management) GIT ---> 
Does he also check in the libraries with it 000> NO he does not ===> 
He simply checks in only his code 000> 

a Developer2 want to use this code and run the code written by developer 1 : 
how does he come to know   what code and what libraries were used by developer 

the answer is :-   
pip freeze 




Deveoper1 - Write a code and he imports a lot dependencies from pypi 
		pip install xxxx 
		pip install yyyy 
		pip install zzzz 


	puts his code in github ---> 
	Developer --  
	pip freeze > requirements.txt  (10 package)

Developer2  tries to use the code in his machine pulling the code github 
		nothing works 

 



1. PyPi is central hub on the internet where alll the libraries / public available libraries are there 

pip install : you installed 1 library for yourself 

pip freeze  >  requirements.txt

Function --  Function in script format where we can write our own function with out  class 
Method : -- later When we have object programming (Classes ) 


	a  Function is also a variable 
	
	def myfunction():
	    // function body start
	
	
	def myfunction(a, b , c ,d ):
		/// 

	def myfunction(a , b , c=10):
		// deffault should always be on the right and not from 		
		the  left

	def myfunction(a , b , c = 10, d = 20 , e = None , f = 'xyz') 
		// 

	myfunction(1,2)

	1. There is no overloading functionality in term of python is more procedural 
	




1. WHat is a construct of function 
	def  function_name(fn_param , fn_paramn=value): 
		body 
		body 
		body 
	
	def add_numbers(a): (With sing args)
		pass

	def add_numbers(a, b ): (multiple args)
		pass
 
	def add_numbers(a, b = 10 ): (with default values)
		pass

	def add_numbers(a, b , c =10): (with default values)
	  	pass

	def add_numbers(*a):  (args varargs)
		pass

	def add_numbers(**a):  (args kwargs)
		pass
	
	def add_numbers(x, y): functions can return values 
		return x+y 

	function can accept functions a parameters 
	functions can return functions are retunr type 

	every thing is a variable ........................ so   every thing can be passed or returned .......  ?




2. how to invoke a function 
	function_name(9333, 2989383)  // this must follow a sequence
	function_name(fn_paramn=9393, fn_param=3993) // this does not mandate 
							 any sequence 
	    
3.  a function can have a parameter with default value however the default should always be on the right (not on the left) 
	def fn(a, b , c =10 ) : 
		pass 
	and not 
	def fn(a=10, b , c): 
		pass
	the function default value for parameters are always to the right 


4.  function can have variable args 
	varargs is   *args 
	def fn(*args): 
		args == tuple that is passed to you 

	fn(1,2,3,4,5,6,.............) all the params will come to you as tuple 


5,   can functions have kword args (instead of tuple can i get a dictionary ) 

	def fn(**args): 
		print(args) 
	{'param': 3 , param : 3}
	user, 
	passwird 
	url 
			
dbConnect(**kwargs)
		






def function_name(fn_param_1 , fn_param_2 ,  fn_param_n):
    // here starts your function body 


1. a function cannot be overloaded ;; it will get overrwritted 
2. a function can have parameter (n) 
3. a function parameters can have default value --> should be always on the right 
4. a funtion can have vargs   (*args)  = is variable argument-. passed as tuple 
	a(1,3,4,5)
5. a function  can have kwargs (*kwargs) = is varaible argument passed as  dict 
	a(p1=1, p2=3) 
6.  a function can have both vargs as well kwargs   so both variations supported 
	a(*args, **kwargs)
	
	---> a (1,2,3,4, a=10, b=20) 
		a and b will go as dict values and 1,2,3,4 will go as tuple 
7.  a function can accept a function as a  parameter 
8.  a function can return a value  or a function also 
9.  a function can be patched 
10.  a lambda is also a anonymous single line function whcih is callable 


Functions : 
What is exception handling :-  

Flow control :- 

		 block code which you wish to try 
		 block of code that would expect to do some wrong and still allow the program to continue or handle it so that it does abrupt out 

	try:
	    line that you want to try 
	    db = connect_to_db(); 
	    file = readMillionLines();
	    1/0
	    db.close() // what happens to my open connection 
	except: 
	    line that you want handle return ot alternative activyt 
	finally: 
		// whethere is expection 
		// whether there is no exception what so ever in the case 
		// both condition the finally will get called 
		// releaser /// Resoource Releasing block 
	


1. Resource Leak 
2. Connnection Leak 
3, File Handle 
4  Activity in the flow could result in memory leak 







try:
   # the lines of code that you wish to execute goes goes here.... 
except DivideByZeroError as e : 
   # handling of the exception
finally: 
   # whatever it takes whatever it goes with i will be consider as always to 
	 if exception still i am executed 
	 if no exception still execute 


try: 
	try : 
		try:
		     #
		except:
		     #
		finally:
		     # 
	except:
	    #
	finally:
	    #
except:
    # 
finally: 
    #
Module and Packages ? 
A module is different and Pacakage is diffrent 

import 

import abc

abc.py 
abc 


abc.py 
   hello()

pqr.py
   hello() 

import abc 
	abc.hello()

import pqr 
	pqr.hello()



from abc import hello as hello1  (aliasing) (Function aliasig)



What is a module ? 
a module is a simple python file any python file is a module which can be imported 

### utils.py #### 
### the demo1 is a method in the Utils secton
def demo1():
    pass 

def demo2():
    pass 

def demo3():
    pass 


##### demo ####### 
import utils  ### utils should be in the path and should be available in the 
utils.demo1();
utils.demo2();
utils.demo3();


import * from utils; 

demo1()
demo2()
demo3()

from utils import demo1 as d1 

d1()




# i do have the activity mapped to the  import inside a function 
# can i import at file level *Yes it will become globals 
# can i import at function level *Yes it will become locals
# can i import all at a one time  using * yes may cause ambigous imports 
# can i import only  the module  Yes  but invocation module.function 
# can i import with aliase and single function Yes this is the best practice 
# does import a module and import a package is differnet to end user no for python yes 


1.  Every file in python is  a module 
2.  Every file can be imported 
3.  When a file imported it executes everything in that file which is a statement and those function will be called when you call them 
	technically you should normally have function only in modules 
4.  When a file is imported the namespace is most important part 
	import utils 
		the namespace is utils 

	from utils import * 
		you have imported all the function fomr the utils module to you current . namespace so the function now in the utils is not directly accessible 5. Kindly note the alias is the saviour and that the only way you can import multiple function in your import even if they are ambigious 

import utils 
import helpers 
import sys 
import os 
import math 
import re 

from utils import x 
from utils import x as y 
from utils import * 




a pacakage is different then a module. 
The package is different then a module. and tthe why 

|------utils 
	 |---- __init__.py
	 |---- helpers.py
	 |---- connect.py 
	 |----- another.py 
	 |---- anotherone.py 

A package is  folder 
	it has special file __init__.py 
	this file get executed by default ireespective of any call to it 








python supports classes but its not fully object oriented 

its like :python suipports more of object based .. rather than object oriented 

1. Can i define a class (Yes) 
2. Can i extend a class (Yes) 
3. Do i have constructor (Yes Pseudo) 
4. Do i have destructors (Yes Pseudo) 
5. Do i have overides  (Yes) 
6. Do i have overloads (No) (Variables) 
7. Do i support abstraction (Yes) with help of abc (Abstract Base Classes) 
8. Can create objects yes 
9. Do I have Static methods (Class Methods) :(Yes)
10. Do I have object level variables (instance varaibles) 
11. Do i support constructor Super  yes (Intheritence) 
12. Do i support interfaces (No) 
13. Do i support Mulitple Interhitence (No) 
14. Do i support mulitlevel inheritence (Yes) 
15. Do i support object refrencing and garbaging *yes (Del) 
16.  Does it have access modifer yes  (_ & __) 
				_ , __ , __x__, x__
How to write a class :- 
class Employee: 
	pass 


Why should i debug code  ?
Runtime value inpsection 
Breaks Conditional Breaking Specific to a location 
Step In / Step Over / Resume Proceed  . Terminate / 
	A():
	 B()
           c()
	     D()

How does a developer write a code : 
	Business Understanding for me is a understanding of very requirements 
	can be must have .... requirement 

In world Agile and Devops driven world we should be first talking about the :- 
	development of the Test Case fierst and development 

Ask a project manager how must is code done ? 50%
	If i have test cases and they passed which means i have written  the code 
	if i dont have test cases consider this as a guess work 
	100 ---> 100 Test cases ---> Pass

	TDD (Test Driven Development) 

	test_login()
		login("" , "passwotrd")
		
	test_logout():
		fail()
	
	test_change_password():
		fail()

	test_register_user():
		fail()


Selenium comes in picture for the web based UI testing : 

1.  install ---> 
	
pip install pytest 
pip install pytest-html
pip install pytest-cov


Goto https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Check your version of Chrome : 
Once you have checked your version of chrome :- download the corressponding chrome driver : 
Place the crhome driver in a folder and set it to your path 
open cmd prompt and check 	--=> where chromedriver 

pip install selenium --- Installs the selenium test library
Then write your first test 

from selenium import webdriver

#pip install selenium
def test_google_home():
    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.maximize_window()
    driver.get("https://www.google.com")
    assert "Google"  == driver.title
    driver.close
